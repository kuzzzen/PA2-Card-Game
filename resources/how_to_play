Select game mode, choose a deck, and start playing!


Each turn, choose one card and press ENTER.
The goal is to get your opponent's HP to zero before they do so to you.
You take one card from the deck every turn.


The game menu shows the cards you can play as well as "Save" and "Exit" options;
If you want to save the game and load it later, choose "Save" before you exit the game.
Your game will be saved to "games" directory under the name you specify.
You can load saved games from the main menu.


If you want to load your own deck, upload a text file to "decks" directory.
The format is the following:
1. Each line represents one card.
2. If you want to place a card into the deck multiple times, simply copy the line again.
3. Each line is a set of space-separated values:
   CARD_NAME CARD_DESCRIPTION CARD_SUIT CARD_DAMAGE CARD_HEALING CARD_RESTRICTION CARD_GET_CARD
4. CARD_DAMAGE and CARD_HEALING fields should contain a value or 0 if not applied.
   CARD_DAMAGE deals damage to your opponent. CARD_HEALING restores your HP.
5. CARD_GET_CARD gives you a card.
   Please specify card name or "-".
6. CARD_RESTRICTION restricts you opponent from playing all cards of some suit in their next turn.
